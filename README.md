# 📌 Project Overview: Connecting MySQL to Python
In this project, I demonstrate how to establish a connection between Python and a MySQL database, enabling full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality through Python scripts.

# ✅ Steps Completed:
# 🛠️ MySQL Installation
I started by installing MySQL on my local machine, following a step-by-step guide to ensure a proper setup of the database environment.

# 🔗 Connecting Python to MySQL
I installed the required connector using the following command:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install mysql-connector-python
This allows Python to communicate directly with the MySQL server.

# 🧠 Performing Database Operations from Python
I wrote Python scripts that interact with the MySQL database to:

Insert new records

Update existing data

Delete records as needed

These operations are executed using Python's mysql.connector library.
